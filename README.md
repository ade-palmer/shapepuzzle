# Shape puzzle


This game was created using vanilla JavaScript and is based on an old favourite from the 80's.

This is my first attempt at using Classes and Objects in JavaScript. Currently it will only work on modern browsers as I wanted to also use JavaScript Modules. The mobile 'touch' features have not been added yet, so this is currently not usable on a mobile phone or tablet.

## Game Play

Select a piece from the bottom ```holding board and it will be added to the ```Game Play board. Using the mouse ```right-click you will have the option to rotate, flip or remove from play. Using the mouse, drag the piece to the decided location. If the piece overlaps or is off the board, it will become slightly transparent.

## Implementation

I've used the early implementation of ‘Static Web Apps’ provided by Azure to host this website and configured the certificate to allow HTTPS. It also uses Azures CDN to allow fast access from any location.
